# PathFinder
This program uses the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two given points.

## Detailed Description
- This project is a path finding application that utilizes the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a given map or grid. The A* algorithm is a widely used, efficient and reliable algorithm for pathfinding and graph traversal. It combines the use of a heuristic function and a cost function to find the optimal path from a starting point to a goal point.

- In this project, the user is provided with a map that represents the environment, where they can plot the starting point and the goal point along with any restrictive regions. The A* algorithm will then analyze the map and find the shortest path from the starting point to the goal point while considering the costs of traversing different areas and using a heuristic function to estimate the remaining distance to the goal.

- The project will be implemented in Python and will provide a user-friendly interface that allows the user to input the starting point and goal point, and visualize the path found by the algorithm. The project will also include options to customize the heuristic function and the cost function used by the A* algorithm, to fine-tune the performance of the pathfinding.

- Overall, this project aims to demonstrate the power and efficiency of the A* algorithm in solving pathfinding problems and finding the optimal path in a given environment. It can be used in various application like Robotics, gaming, and navigation.
